last formula for positive numbers was this : 

  let firstTwo = [0, 1];
    for(let  i = 2 ; i < n ; i++){
        firstTwo[i] = firstTwo[i - 2 ] + firstTwo[i - 1] 
    }
    
 But with negative numbers doesnt work ; 
 Let's create a negative formula.
 
 for( let i = -1 ; i < -1 ; i--) {
     firstTwo[-1] = firstTwo[-1 + 2 ] + firstTwo[-1 + 1] 
     
  Now the [-1 ] = index of 1 + index of 0 = 1 + 0 = 1  
  
  But does it work ? Let's try it!
